<!-- Introducing Bukin where you can make your next appointment at a salon in a easy and simple way at your fingers.

We have worked little over a week on this project.

As of now, when you enter the website:
We only have our Book now button working.
This button will allow you to get your current location and look for beauty salons around you in 1 mile.
Then when you are ready to make an appointment, you should be able to register your name, phone and email with the date and time for the appointment to be set.
You will get a notification and confirmation as a customer to your cell in a sec.
    

We used:
    - HTML and CSS,
    - Javascript and JQuery,
    - NodeJS,
    - React,
    - Nexmo

Many features needs to be finished and also added.-->
